# SEO Migration Roadmap

1. **Audit current URLs** – export a full list of pages from [tpgmedical.group](https://tpgmedical.group/) and match them to the new Next.js routes.
2. **Implement 301 redirects** – configure redirects in `next.config.ts` for any changed URLs to preserve backlink equity.
3. **Replicate metadata** – carry over page titles, descriptions and structured data from the old site. Update with new content where necessary.
4. **Submit new sitemap** – generate `sitemap.xml` and submit it to Google Search Console right after launch.
5. **Update internal links** – ensure all links within the site use the final URLs and include `hreflang` for multilingual pages.
6. **Monitor search performance** – track rankings and crawl errors for several weeks after migration and address any issues quickly.
7. **Maintain content quality** – keep existing high‑performing content and gradually improve it using new design and structured data.
